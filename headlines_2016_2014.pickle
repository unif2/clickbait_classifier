BORN IN NEW YORK CITY, TANYA ATTENDED TAFT HIGH SCHOOL, CITY COLLEGE AND THE HUNTER SCHOOL OF SOCIAL WORK. SHE MARRIED EDWARD SPARER, AND UNTIL HIS DEATH IN 1983, THEY WORKED TOGETHER IN WAYS BOTH BIG AND SMALL TO MAKE THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE. TANYA WAS A PSYCHIATRIC SOCIAL WORKER, THOROUGHLY DEVOTED TO HER PATIENTS' WELL BEING, AND AN ENDLESS SEEKER OF INTELLECTUAL, SPIRITUAL, AND RELIGIOUS ENRICHMENT. SHE IS SURVIVED BY HER THREE CHILDREN, ELLEN, MICHAEL AND CAROL AND THEIR SPOUSES, HARALD, JO, AND DAVID; HER SEVEN GRANDCHILDREN, ESTHER, EMILY, MADELINE, ARIK, HANNAH, ABIGAIL AND SAMUEL; HER AUNT HILDA, WITH WHOM SHE SHARED SO MUCH OF HER LIFE; AND HER MANY CLOSE FRIENDS AND RELATIVES. NONE OF US CAN IMAGINE A WORLD WITHOUT TANYA. WE WILL MISS FOREVER HER WARMTH, GENEROSITY AND LOVE. A MEMORIAL SERVICE WILL BE HELD ON APRIL 6, 2015, AT THE RIVERSIDE MEMORIAL CHAPEL, ON AMSTERDAM AND 76TH STREET. BURIAL TO FOLLOW AT THE MONTREPOSE CEMETERY IN KINGSTON, NEW YORK. 1
